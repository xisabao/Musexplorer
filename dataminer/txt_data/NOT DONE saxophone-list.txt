melodies, as well as widely known composers, including 
Bach, Corelli, Purcell, and Bizet. Pieces are longer and 
more technically challenging, and endurance becomes 
a larger factor in practice and performance. Elements 
of jazz are introduced for the first time in the technical 
requirements.

Examination Credit
An examination credit (formerly called a “fee extension”) may be applied to the fee 
of a future examination. Examination credits are valid for one year from the date of 
the original scheduled examination. Examination credits can be redeemed when the 
candidate registers for his or her next examination. The credit will be automatically 
applied during the online registration process. Please note that credits are not transferrable 
and may not be extended beyond one year.

Fee Refund
Candidates who know at the time they are applying for an examination credit that they 
will not be able to make use of it within the one-year time period may instead apply for 
a refund of fifty percent of the examination fee.
Requests for examination refunds or credits must be made to The Royal Conservatory 
in writing and be accompanied by the necessary documentation (see above). All requests 
must be submitted by mail or by fax within two weeks following the scheduled examination date.

Candidates with Special Needs
Candidates with special needs should submit a Special Needs Request Form, by mail

payment of the requisite fee. (The Official Transcript Request Form may be downloaded 
from the website.) 

Interpreting Examination Results
All candidates may access their complete, official results (including examiners’ 
comments) online no later than eight weeks after the examination has taken place. The 
examiner’s report explains in general terms how the official mark was calculated, and 
provides information to support candidates in their future musical development. The 
official mark reflects the examiner’s evaluation of the candidate’s performance during 
the examination, which cannot be reconstructed. Appeals are considered only in the 
event of a serious procedural irregularity, and only upon completion of the official 
Appeals Process. 

The Special Needs 
Request Form is 
available online at

Marking Criteria for Performance of Repertoire
First Class Honors with Distinction: 90–100
This standing is awarded for exceptional performances that are confident and 
communicative, while demonstrating technical command, insightful awareness of style, 
and convincing musical interpretation.

First Class Honors: 80–89
This standing is awarded for performances that are musically engaging, show thoughtful 
preparation, and demonstrate technical security, stylistic understanding, and musical 
awareness. There is quick recovery from any minor slips or brief lapses.

Honors: 70–79
This standing is awarded for performances that are generally secure and fluent, indicate 
careful preparation, and reflect some awareness of style and musical understanding. 
There may be occasional slips or lapses, with room for further development of technical 
control and attention to musical details.

Pass: 60–69
This standing is awarded for performances that exhibit a basic level of preparation. 
There may be slips or lapses, loss of continuity, unresolved technical issues, and a lack 
of attention to musical details. The examiner’s report will identify areas that require 
further study and exploration.

Insufficient to Pass: 50–59
The performance is a work in progress. There are many errors, slips, and stumbles 
disturbing the continuity. Although some aspects of the performance may show basic 
preparation, a satisfactory performance requires more consistent fluency and attention 
to both musical elements and markings in the score.

Marks Below 50
The performance is not yet ready for assessment due to insufficient preparation.

Beginning in the 2013–2014 academic year, candidates may choose to take the Grade 10 
Saxophone examination in two separate segments: one consisting entirely of Repertoire; 
the other consisting of Technical Requirements, including Etudes and Technical Tests, 
as well as Ear Tests, Sight Reading, and Orchestral Excerpts. The division of material 
in the split Grade 10 examination cannot be altered. However, candidates may choose 
which segment to take first. 
Candidates for the split Grade 10 examination must complete all practical examination 
requirements within two years of the initial examination segment. Candidates for the 
split Grade 10 examination may schedule their examinations within the same session or 
in different sessions; however, both segments of the split Grade 10 examination and any 
supplemental examinations must be completed within the two-year period. Candidates 
who choose the split format must complete both segments before registering for any 
supplemental examinations. All theory co-requisites for the Grade 10 examination must 
be completed within five years of the initial Grade 10 practical examination segment. 
Only candidates who take the complete Grade 10 examination (without the split) will be 
eligible to receive a regional gold medal.

Practical Examination Certificates
Certificates are awarded to candidates who successfully complete the requirements for 
their grade. 
Beginning in Grade 5, certificates are awarded after both the theory co-requisites and 
the practical examination for that grade have been successfully completed. Theory co-
requisites must be completed within five years of the original practical examination. 

Medals
The academic year runs from September to August. Each academic year, gold medals are 
awarded to candidates who achieve exceptional examination results. No application is 
required. 

Gold Medals
Gold medals are awarded by province or region to candidates in Preparatory and Grades 
1 to 10 who receive the highest marks for the respective practical examinations. To 
be eligible, a candidate must receive a minimum mark of 80 percent in the practical 
examination and have completed all the theory co-requisites for the respective grade.

Candidates in Grade 
10 must complete the 
Grade 10 theory co-
requisites within five 
years of the original 
practical examination, 
not any subsequent 

supplemental 
examinations.

Please note that ARCT 
diplomas are awarded 
to candidates at the 
annual Convocation 
ceremony. Candidates 
may not use the official 

designation “ARCT” 
before Convocation.

School Credits
The Royal Conservatory examination results can sometimes be used as a credit toward 
high school graduation or toward university entrance. In Canada, the policies of 
provincial education ministries can be found online under “Candidate Recognition, 
Accreditation.” Candidates are advised to discuss the eligibility of their examination 
results with their school principal or guidance counselor.

RESPs
Use of Education Funds for Music Studies 
Candidates who have a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) may be eligible to use 
these funds to support private studies in music at the Grade 9, Grade 10, and/or ARCT 
levels. Candidates should consult their RESP providers for more information.

Editions
For many repertoire items, the Syllabus listing includes a suggested edition (indicated by 
an assigned publisher abbreviation). These editions have been chosen for their quality 
and for their availability in North America.
The Royal Conservatory strongly encourages the use of modern editions. These editions 
benefit from current scholarship and provide a reliable basis for study and performance. 
However, if a student has purchased an online edition or downloaded a free edition 
that is in the public domain, they must provide either proof of payment, in the case of 
purchased editions, or proof of legal, free download, in the case of online editions in the 
public domain.
Editorial markings vary from edition to edition. Examination marks will not be 
deducted for altering these editorial suggestions as long as the resulting change is 
musically acceptable.

Availability
The Royal Conservatory has made every effort to ensure that the materials listed in 
the Saxophone Syllabus, 2014 Edition are in print and available at leading music retailers 
throughout North America. If you experience difficulty in obtaining saxophone music 
in your community, you may visit www.frederickharrismusic.com to find a listing of 
additional music retailers near you.

Anthologies and Collections
If a repertoire selection is published in a collection of a composer’s music or in an 
anthology containing music by a number of composers, the title of the collection or 
anthology is usually included in the Syllabus listing. Individual selections may also be 
found in other sources. In order to save space, the words “volume” and “book” have 
usually been omitted; a number following a title indicates the number of the volume, 
book, or set number in which a selection can be found (for example, Classic Festival 
Solos: Alto, 2).

Saxophone Series, 2014 Edition
In order to ensure the ready availability of high-quality examination materials, The 
Frederick Harris Music Co., Limited has published Saxophone Series, 2014 Edition. This 
series includes nine volumes of Saxophone Repertoire (Preparatory through Grade 8) with 
recordings; one volume of Saxophone Technique (Preparatory–Grade 10); two volumes 
of Saxophone Etudes (Preparatory–Grade 4; Grades 5–8); and one volume of Orchestral 
Excerpts (Grades 7–ARCT). 

Copyright and Photocopying
Federal and international copyright laws prohibit the use of photocopies without the 
permission of the publisher. The use of unauthorized photocopies for examination 
purposes constitutes copyright infringement as outlined in the Copyright Act of 
Canada. Additional information about federal copyright law is available online through 
the Copyright Board of Canada at www.cb-cda.gc.ca. 
Candidates should bring all music to be performed to the examination. Candidates 
who wish to photocopy one page of a selection to facilitate a page turn must do so with 
permission from the publisher.
With this notice, The Frederick Harris Music Co., Limited grants permission to festival, 
recital, and examination participants to photocopy single pages from their publications

Thematic Catalogues
Opus Numbers and Catalogue Numbers
“Opus” (op.) is a term used with a number to designate the position of a given work 
in the chronological sequence of works by the composer. However, these numbers are 
often an unreliable guide, and may have been assigned by a publisher rather than the 
composer. Sometimes a single work will have conflicting opus numbers. Certain genres, 
such as operas and other vocal works, were not always assigned opus numbers. For 
these reasons, individual works by a number of composers are identified by numbers 
assigned in scholarly thematic catalogues. A number of the more important thematic 
catalogues are listed below.

Johann Sebastian Bach
Works by J.S. Bach are identified by BWV numbers (for example, Partita No. 2 in  
D Minor, BWV, 1004). “BWV” is the abbreviation for Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, the short 
title of the Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann 
Sebastian Bach (Leipzig, 1950), a thematic catalogue of Bach’s complete works originally 
compiled by the German music librarian Wolfgang Schmieder. 

George Frideric Handel
Works by George Frideric Handel are identified by HWV numbers (for example, Sonata 
No. 2 in G Minor, HWV 368). “HWV” is an abbreviation for Handel Werke Verzeichnis. 
The full title for this thematic catalogue, compiled by Margaret and Walter Eisen, is 
Händel-Handbuch, gleichzeitig Suppl. zu Hallische Händel-Ausgabe (Kassel: Bärenreiter, 
1978–1986).

Franz Joseph Haydn
Works by Haydn are identified by Hoboken numbers (for example, String Quartet in  
C Major (“The Bird”), Hob. III:39). Anthony van Hoboken was a Dutch musicologist.  
His thematic catalogue, Joseph Haydn: Thematisch-bibliographisches Werkverzeichnis 
(Mainz, B. Schott, 1957–1971) divides Haydn’s works into a number of categories that 
are indicated by Roman numerals. 

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
Works by Mozart are identified by K numbers (for example, Symphony No. 25 in 
G Minor, K 183). “K” stands for Köchel Verzeichnis first published in 1862. Ludwig 
Ritter von Köchel (1800–1877) was an Austrian professor of botany who devoted 
his retirement years to collecting all the known works by Mozart. He created a 
chronological catalogue in which these works are listed and numbered.

Henry Purcell

Works by Henry Purcell are identified by Z numbers (for example, Minuet in  
G Major, Z 651). These numbers were assigned by Franklin B. Zimmerman in his 
thematic catalogue of Purcell’s works, Henry Purcell: An Analytical Catalogue of his Music 
(London: MacMillan, 1963).

Franz Schubert
Works by Schubert are identified by Deutsch numbers (for example, String Quartet  
No. 14 in D Minor (“Death and the Maiden”), D 810). These numbers were assigned 
by Otto Erich Deutsch (1883–1967) in his thematic catalogue of Schubert‘s works, 
Thematisches Verzeichnis seiner Werke in chronologischer Folge (Neue Schubert Ausgabe  
Serie VIII, Bd. 4, Kassel, 1978). 

79

Examination Regulations

Georg Philipp Telemann
Works by Telemann are identified by TWV numbers (for example, Sonata in F Major, 
TWV 41:F1). TWV is an abbreviation for Telemann Werkverzeichnis. This thematic 
catalogue—Thematisch-Systematisches Verzeichnis seiner Werke: Telemann Werkverzeichnis 
(Kassel: Bärenreiter, 1984)—was compiled by Martin Ruhnke.

Antonio Vivaldi
Works by Vivaldi are identified by RV numbers and/or by F numbers (for example, 
Concerto in A Minor, op. 3, no. 6 RV 356/F I:176). RV is an abbreviation for Ryom 
Verzeichnis. This thematic catalogue of Vivaldi’s works—Verzeichnis der Werke Antonio 
Vivaldis: kleine Ausgabe (Leipzig: Deutscher Verlag für Musik, 1974, 2nd ed. 1979) 
was compiled by Peter Ryom. The F numbers were assigned by Antonio Fanna in 
Opere strumentali di Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741): catalogo numerico-tematico secondo la 
catalogazione Fanna (Milan, 1986). 

Anhang
Some catalogue numbers include the prefix Anh. (for example, Notenbuch der Anna 
Magdalena Bach, BWV Anh. 114). Anh. is an abbreviation for Anhang, a German word 
meaning appendix or supplement.

WoO
Some catalogue numbers include the prefix WoO (for example, Sechs Menuette,  
WoO 10). WoO is an abbreviation for Werk ohne Opuszahl (work without opus 
number). These numbers are used to designate works for which the composer did  
not assign an opus number.

With this notice, The Frederick Harris Music Co., Limited grants permission to festival, 
recital, and examination participants to photocopy single pages from their publications 
to facilitate a page turn.

How do I choose the best edition for a piece?
The best editions often have minimal editorial markings. These editions, often called 
Urtext, are available from most music retailers. If you are unsure about the best edition, 
ask your music retailer for suggestions.

Should candidates follow repeat signs? Da capo markings?
Candidates should observe da capo markings at an examination performance. Repeat 
signs should usually be ignored; however, repeat signs should be observed if indicated 
in a footnote below the music in Saxophone Series, 2014 Edition or if indicated in the

Theory Co-requisites
What is a theory co-requisite? 
A theory co-requisite is a theory examination that must be completed before or within 
five years of the practical examination if the candidate wishes to receive a certificate for 
the practical examination. Candidates are encouraged to begin theory studies as early as 
possible.

Do I have to take theory examinations if I don’t need a saxophone 
examination certificate?
You may take a saxophone examination at any grade except ARCT without fulfilling 
theory requirements. If you later decide that you would like to receive a certificate, 
you have five years from the date of the saxophone examination to fulfill the theory 
requirements. Candidates must complete prerequisite examinations in theory at least 
one session prior to attempting the ARCT in Saxophone Performance or the Teacher’s 
ARCT.

Where can I find sample theory examination papers?
Official Examination Papers are published annually by The Frederick Harris Music Co., 
Limited to aid with examination preparation. Each book includes three examinations 
from the previous December, May, and August examination sessions plus an additional 
examination created for extra practice. Editions for three academic years are available at 
any given time and may be purchased from your local music retailer.
